# Data-Wrangling-Mini-Project

This mini project is part of spring board data science bootcamp. In this project, I worked on information of global projects funded by World Bank. The enitre data consists of 1500 rows and 50 columns. 

My initial goals in this project were:

1 - Getting some intial insight of data

2 - Finding the countries with most projects

3 - Finding the major projects themes all around the world
