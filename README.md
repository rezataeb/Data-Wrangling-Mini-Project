# Data-Wrangling-Mini-Project

This mini project is part of spring board data science bootcamp. In this project, I worked on information of global projects funded by World Bank. The enitre data consists of 1500 rows and 50 columns. The data of this project can be found: [here](https://github.com/rezataeb/Data-Wrangling-Mini-Project/blob/master/world_bank_projects.json) 

My initial goals in this project were:

1 - Getting some intial insight of data

2 - Finding the countries with most projects

3 - Finding the major projects themes all around the world

The main code can be found : [here] (https://github.com/rezataeb/Data-Wrangling-Mini-Project/blob/master/Data-Wrangling-Project-Code.ipynb)
